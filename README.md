<b> Experiment|     <b> Computation of various physical and chemical properties of Proteins and DNA from their primary sequence and experiment number 1

### About the Experiment 

The primary sequence of both proteins and DNA contains crucial information that can help us in computing various physical and chemical parameters. 

The objectives of this experiment are:
1.	The molecular mass, extinction coefficient, and theoretical pI of protein will be computed and analysed based on its amino acid sequence.
2.	The molecular mass and melting temperature of  DNA will be deciphered based on the nucleotide sequence
